## chapter 3-1

Make an input layer for home vs. away

```python
# Create an Input for each team
team_in_1 = Input(shape=(1,), name='Team-1-In')
team_in_2 = Input(shape=(1,), name='Team-2-In')

# Create an input for home vs away
home_in = Input(shape=(1,), name='Home-In')

# Lookup the team inputs in the team strength model
team_1_strength = team_strength_model(team_in_1)
team_2_strength = team_strength_model(team_in_2)

# Combine the team strengths with the home input using a Concatenate layer, then add a Dense layer
out = Concatenate()([team_1_strength, team_2_strength, home_in])
out = Dense(1)(out)

```

## chapter 3-2

Make a model and compile it

```python
# Import the model class
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Make a Model
model = Model([team_in_1, team_in_2, home_in], out)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=mean_absolute_error)

```

## chapter 3-3

Fit the model and evaluate

```python
# Train your model for 20 epochs
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs = 20)

# Evaluate your model accuracy on the test set
accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)[1]

# Print accuracy
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)

```

Is this dollar bill fake ?

```python
# Train your model for 20 epochs
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs = 20)

# Evaluate your model accuracy on the test set
accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)[1]

# Print accuracy
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
