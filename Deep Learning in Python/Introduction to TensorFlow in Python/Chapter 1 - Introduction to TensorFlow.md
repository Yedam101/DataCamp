## chapter 1-1

Defining data as constants

```python
# Import constant from TensorFlow
from tensorflow import constant

# Convert the credit_numpy array into a tensorflow constant
credit_constant = constant(credit_numpy)

# Print constant datatype
print('\n The datatype is:', credit_constant.dtype)

# Print constant shape
print('\n The shape is:', credit_constant.shape)

```

## chapter 1-2

Defining variables

```python
# Define the 1-dimensional variable A1
A1 = Variable([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Print the variable A1
print('\n A1: ', A1)

# Convert A1 to a numpy array and assign it to B1
B1 = A1.numpy()

# Print B1
print('\n B1: ', B1)

```

## chapter 1-3

Performing element-wise multiplication

```python
# Define tensors A1 and A23 as constants
A1 = constant([1, 2, 3, 4])
A23 = constant([[1, 2, 3], [1, 6, 4]])

# Define B1 and B23 to have the correct shape
B1 = ones_like(A1)
B23 = ones_like(A23)

# Perform element-wise multiplication
C1 = multiply(A1, B1)
C23 = multiply(A23, B23)

# Print the tensors C1 and C23
print('\n C1: {}'.format(C1.numpy()))
print('\n C23: {}'.format(C23.numpy()))

```

## chapter 1-4

Making predictions with matrix multiplication

```python
# Define features, params, and bill as constants
features = constant([[2, 24], [2, 26], [2, 57], [1, 37]])
params = constant([[1000], [150]])
bill = constant([[3913], [2682], [8617], [64400]])

# Compute billpred using features and params
billpred = matmul(features, params)

# Compute and print the error
error = bill - billpred
print(error.numpy())

```

## chapter 1-5

Reshaping tensors

```python
# Reshape the grayscale image tensor into a vector
gray_vector = reshape(gray_tensor, (784, 1))

# Reshape the color image tensor into a vector
color_vector = reshape(color_tensor, (2352, 1))

```

## chapter 1-6

Optimizing with gradients

```python
def compute_gradient(x0):
  	# Define x as a variable with an initial value of x0
	x = Variable(x0)
	with GradientTape() as tape:
		tape.watch(x)
        # Define y using the multiply operation
		y = multiply(x, x)
    # Return the gradient of y with respect to x
	return tape.gradient(y, x).numpy()

# Compute and print gradients at x = -1, 1, and 0
print(compute_gradient(-1.0))
print(compute_gradient(1.0))
print(compute_gradient(0.0))

```

## chapter 1-7

Working with image data

```python
# Reshape model from a 1x3 to a 3x1 tensor
model = reshape(model, (3,1))

# Multiply letter by model
output = matmul(letter, model)

# Sum over output and print prediction using the numpy method
prediction = reduce_sum(output)
print(prediction.numpy())

```
