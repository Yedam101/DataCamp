## chapter 1-3

k-Nearest Neighbors: Fit

```python
# Import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier 

# Create arrays for the features and the target variable
y = churn_df["churn"].values
X = churn_df[["account_length", "customer_service_calls"]].values

# Create a KNN classifier with 6 neighbors
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X, y)

```

## chapter 1-4

k-Nearest Neighbors: Predict

```python
# Predict the labels for the X_new
y_pred = knn.predict(X_new)

# Print the predictions for X_new
print("Predictions: {}".format(y_pred)) 

```

## chapter 1-5

Train/test split + computing accuracy

```python
# Import the module
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = churn_df.drop("churn", axis=1).values
y = churn_df["churn"].values

# Split into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

# Fit the classifier to the training data
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the accuracy
print(knn.score(X_test, y_test))

```

## chapter 1-6

Overfitting and underfitting

```python
# Create neighbors
neighbors = np.arange(1, 13)
train_accuracies = {}
test_accuracies = {}

for neighbor in neighbors:
  
	# Set up a KNN Classifier
	knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=neighbor)
  
	# Fit the model
	knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
  
	# Compute accuracy
	train_accuracies[neighbor] = knn.score(X_train, y_train)
	test_accuracies[neighbor] = knn.score(X_test, y_test)

print(neighbors, '\n', train_accuracies, '\n', test_accuracies)

```

## chapter 1-7

Visualizing model complexity

```python
# Add a title
plt.title("KNN: Varying Number of Neighbors")

# Plot training accuracies
plt.plot(neighbors, train_accuracies.values(),label="Training Accuracy")

# Plot test accuracies
plt.plot(neighbors, test_accuracies.values(), label="Testing Accuracy")

plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("Number of Neighbors")
plt.ylabel("Accuracy")

# Display the plot
plt.show()

```
